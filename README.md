## 📄 Pages Included

The project consists of **4 HTML pages**:

1. **`taskmain.html`** – Main dashboard to navigate between add, edit, and view tasks  
2. **`addtask.html`** – Allows users to create new tasks  
3. **`edittask.html`** – Enables editing, removing, or updating existing tasks  
4. **`tasklist.html`** – Displays tasks based on selected user and status  

All pages are interlinked, allowing users to navigate between them without always returning to the main page.
